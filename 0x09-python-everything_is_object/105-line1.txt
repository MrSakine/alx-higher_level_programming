262
In CPython, there is a concept of small integer caching. The integers in the range of -5 to 256 are pre-allocated and cached for performance reasons. These integers are commonly used in Python programs, so they are reused instead of creating new objects every time.
The NSMALLPOSINTS constant represents the number of pre-allocated positive small integers, which is set to 257 by default. The NSMALLNEGINTS constant represents the number of pre-allocated negative small integers, which is set to -5 by default.
Since the code does not involve any explicit creation or manipulation of int objects, the pre-allocated small integers are the only int objects in memory before the execution of line 2. Therefore, there are 262 int objects in memory.
This optimization helps to reduce memory usage and improve performance when working with small integers in Python.
